Instructions

1. **150** points will be earned from pre-selected problems, covering the basics (loop, conditional, data types, etc..)
2. **150** points will be earned flexibly, allowing you to choose freely the problems to
solve (different difficulties reward different points (2, 8, 32, &
128 for the most difficult levels).

The pre-selected problems are all beginner level (thus providing 2 points per solution).

PS:
 Keep in mind that some points are automatically given to the user when
ranking up (and other activities not necessarily related to solving
problems. A Full explanation of how the points system works can be found
 here).

Use Java and Convert to JS to do it quicker.
